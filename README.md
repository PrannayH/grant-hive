# Granthive: Streamlining Grant Management for Student Projects

## Overview

"Granthive" is a Database Management System (DBMS) project built on MySQL, dedicated to enhancing the funding process for students' projects. The system aims to streamline the grant application and allocation process, making it efficient and accessible for both students and funding committees.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** Granthive provides a web-based interface to facilitate easy interaction with the system. Users can submit grant proposals, review panel members can evaluate proposals, and funding committees can allocate grants.

- **Entity Structure:** The Granthive database comprises several entities, including the application organization, grant proposal, grant program, review panel, and funded projects. Each entity is designed with relevant attributes and establishes relational and referential constraints to maintain a coherent and interconnected data structure.

- **Grant Application Workflow:** The system follows a structured workflow where the application organization collects project details from students, submits grant proposals, and a dedicated panel reviews and scores the proposals. Successful proposals transform into grant programs, and funding committees evaluate and allocate grants to support selected projects.

- **Query Execution:** Granthive enables users to execute complex queries through the website, providing a means to manage and access critical information. This feature enhances the overall efficiency of the grant allocation process.
