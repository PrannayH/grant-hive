# grant-hive
"Granthive" is a Database Management System (DBMS) project built on MySQL, aimed at streamlining the funding process for students' projects. The project facilitates students in securing the necessary grants from diverse funding committees to successfully initiate and execute their projects. 
In the Granthive system, an application organization collects project details from students and submits grant proposals. These proposals are then subject to review by a dedicated panel, receiving scores and feedback, ultimately transforming into grant programs. Subsequently, funding committees evaluate the grant programs and allocate grants to support the selected projects.
The Granthive database encompasses several entities, including the application organization, grant proposal, grant program, review panel, and funded projects, each with relevant attributes and established relational and referential constraints that interconnect these entities.
To provide an accessible and user-friendly interface for this process, a website will be developed. This website will display the database's content and allow users to execute complex queries, simplifying the management and accessibility of critical information for all stakeholders involved in the grant allocation process. 
Granthive represents an efficient and comprehensive solution to streamline the grant application and allocation process, benefiting both students and funding committees alike.
